        <h2>What is Bench Press Ben?</h2>

        <p class="mainTextBox blueBack">
            Bench Press Ben is a game about a man named Ben who is charged with
            the responsibility to throw a heavy weight at nuclear chickens before
            they hit the ground.  He also must recapture that same weight because
            dropping it would cramp Ben's style.  
            <strong>This game is a work in progress.</strong>
            It's being developed for Android and iphone but I have ported it over
            to HTML5 so that the alpha version is playable in your browser!  Bugs
            are to be expected given its current alpha state.

            Ben is just your average joe with huge muscles.  You control Ben in
            <i>Bench Press Ben</i> and work to defend the surface from the tyranny
            of the nuclear chickens.  <span id="directions">You use the 
            <b>arrows keys</b> to move Ben and <b>press 'Z'</b> to throw
            the weight at the chickens raining from above or you can use the 
            <b>onscreen-buttons</b> for the same purpose</span>.

            <img class="imageRight orangeBack" src="cyclobat.png" alt="Cyclobat">

            Cyclobat has only one eye and a big red sore on its head.  Like nuclear
            chickens, these critters are dangerous.  In order to knock one out, the
            weight ben throws will have to land on Cyclobat's sore on its head.  He
            may only have one eye but he cleans up well on prom night.

            Want to get Ben even more pumped!?!  Then snatch a preWorkout powerup.
            These powerups periodically float down.  Be careful NOT to break one of
            these powerups with Ben's weight.  Let it float down to Ben.

            My name is Brock Peterson.  I have played around with game development for
            many years.  At approximately 13 years old, I had a dream that one day I
            would be able to create games for other people to play.  I can't wait to
            release my game on Android and Iphone so that my dream may become reality.
            Even if only a small handful of people wind up playing it, that's good
            enough for me.
